This project focuses on developing a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify mountain names in textual data.
The model is based on a pre-trained bert-base-uncased and fine-tuned on a curated dataset containing mountain-related entities.
manually calculated accuracy rate is 83.8%
for training was used dataset located at this link https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gepe55o/mountain-ner-dataset
